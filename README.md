# terraform-arch-oci-oke

These is Terraform module that deploys [Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/home.htm) on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure).

## About
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud. Use Container Engine for Kubernetes (sometimes abbreviated to just OKE) when your development team wants to reliably build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications. 

## Prerequisites
1. Download and install Terraform (v1.0 or later)
2. Download and install the OCI Terraform Provider (v4.4.0 or later)
3. Export OCI credentials. (this refer to the https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci )


## What's a Module?
A Module is a canonical, reusable, best-practices definition for how to run a single piece of infrastructure, such as a database or server cluster. Each Module is created using Terraform, and includes automated tests, examples, and documentation. It is maintained both by the open source community and companies that provide commercial support.
Instead of figuring out the details of how to run a piece of infrastructure from scratch, you can reuse existing code that has been proven in production. And instead of maintaining all that infrastructure code yourself, you can leverage the work of the Module community to pick up infrastructure improvements through a version number bump.

## How to use this Module
Each Module has the following folder structure:
* [root](): This folder contains a root module.
* [examples](): This folder contains examples of how to use the module:
  - [Fully Private OKE (LB, APIEndpoint and NodePool in private subnets) + network deployed by module](examples/oke-fully-private-no-existing-network): This is an example of how to use the oci-oke module to deploy Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) with VCN-native support and all subnets are private and network cloud infrastrucutre elements will be deployed within the body of the module.
  - [Fully Private OKE (LB, APIEndpoint and NodePool in private subnets) + custom network injected into module](examples/oke-fully-private-use-existing-network): This is an example of how to use the oci-oke module to deploy Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) with VCN-native support and all subnets are private and network cloud infrastrucutre elements will be injected into the module.

```hcl
module "oci-oke" {
  source                 = "github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-oke"
  compartment_ocid       = ${var.compartment_ocid}
  vcn                    = ${var.vcn_id}
  api_endpoint_subnet_id = ${var.api_endpoint_subnet_id}
  lb_subnet_id           = ${var.lb_subnet_id}
  node_subnet_id         = ${var.node_subnet_id}
  ssh_public_key         = ${var.ssh_public_key}
